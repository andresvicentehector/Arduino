Pressure Test at OpenROV HQ 7-20-2016 (3" OpenCTD)
===================================

### Background

We took the Lake Superior prototype to OpenROV headquarters to find out the failure limit for non-pressure compensated operation. 

### Results

* The first test held until 25m. 

* The second test failed at 6m. 

* In both cases, the test cap failed. The epoxy housing and sensor passthroughs held. 

* Variation in success rate is likely due to tightness of the Oatey test cap. 

As it currently stands, if you want to avoid working with mineral oil, we can recommend non-pressure compensated operation to 5m, while bolder users can consider pushing the limit to 25m. 

Pressure Test at OpenROV HQ 8-28-2017 (2" OpenCTD)
=====================================

### Background

We sent a purpose-built 2" diameter OpenCTD to OpenROV headquarters for a second round of non-pressure compensated depth tests. We did not have telemetry data for these tests. 

### Results

* The 2" OpenCTD was submerged to 100m without citical failure or leakage.

To avoid mineral oil, we recommend constructing 2" OpenCTDs for deployments up to 100m.
